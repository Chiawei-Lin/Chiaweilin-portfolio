The concept was to focus heavily on pink tones, Y2K aesthetics, and pop culture influences. \n As you can see, the entire title sequence follows the pink-themed look. Every element in the sequence reflects key aspects of the show, ensuring the visuals align seamlessly with the narrative and overall style. \n The laptop scene was the first one I modeled to present Anton with the creative style, color palette, and composition. The materials used in this scene primarily come from Redshift assets. The image displayed on the laptop screen is something I created specifically for this project; it will be replaced with actual footage from the show in the final version. \n I modeled the logo using the Pen Tool in C4D, extruded it, and adjusted the points to make it look smoother. I spent a significant amount of time refining the logo's details, focusing on the curves and roundness of the text to ensure it was both visually appealing and readable.",

The process came with its challenges. For instance, when 3D models were pre-composed, their 3D functionality was limited. Additionally, combining 3D and 2D animations required special attention to details. One example was ensuring the vine’s path, as it wrapped around the back of the moon, precisely matched the moon’s curvature.

          "en": "One of our classmates, Andrew Louda, designed the overall aesthetics of the animation. In total, we needed to create 25 awards animations to showcase on the premiere day. However, there were only four 3D modeling artists on the team, including me. Each of us was assigned to create one or two environments and set up three different camera perspectives for each. I contributed by creating one 3D environment and two text animations for the awards. \n For the floor, I used a Cloner to replicate squares and adjusted the values to create an uneven surface. This design choice ensures that when the screen lights up, the floor casts dynamic shadows, adding depth and enhancing the overall visual appeal. \n For the ceiling, I wanted to incorporate flags that reflect the screen's light, evoking the feel of glowing waves in a dark pool. To achieve this, I applied a Cloth tag to the plane and used a Cloner for the flags. I added a Rope tag to secure the flags to the ceiling, preventing them from falling to the floor, and a Connector tag to link the splines to the flags. Together, these elements created a realistic and visually engaging effect. \n I also include the initail design for the environment. The setup was shorter and larger in size, inspired by an art gallery display type of environment. However, since the theme of the festival was “theater-like,” Professor Kalis suggested incorporating a large screen in each environment to create a cohesive theme. I believe this change worked out really well, especially when all the different environments were displayed side by side. \n Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and felt incredibly proud to see my animation played on the theater screen at the Music Box. It was truly an unforgettable experience.",
          "zh": "我們的同學 Andrew Louda 設計了動畫的整體美學。在這個專案中，我們需要製作25 個獎項動畫以供首映日展示。然而，團隊中包含我，只有四位 3D 建模師。我們每個人都被分配了創建一到兩個空間，並為每個環境設置三個不同的攝影機視角。我製作一個 3D 空間和兩個獎項的文字動畫。 在製作地板時，我使用了 Cloner 來複製方塊，並調整了數值，創造出不平整的表面。這樣的設計，確保當螢幕亮起時，地板會投射出動態陰影，增添了深度並提升整體視覺效果。\n 在天花板部分，我希望加入可以反射出螢幕光線的旗幟，營造出黑暗中池塘中發光波紋的感覺。為了達成這一效果，我將 Cloth 標籤應用於旗幟，並使用 Cloner 來複製旗幟。我還加上了 Rope 標籤將旗幟固定在天花板上，防止它們掉到地板上，並使用 Connector 標籤將線條與旗幟連接。這些元素共同創造了一個真實且引人入勝的視覺效果。 \n 我也提供了最初的空間設計。這些設計比較矮且較寬敞，靈感來自於藝術畫廊展示類型的空間。然而，由於影展的主題是「劇院式」，Kalis 教授建議在每個空間中加入大型螢幕，以創造一致的主題。我認為這個修改非常成功，尤其是當所有不同的空間並排展示時。\n 總體來說，我非常享受這個專案，並且在看到我的動畫在音樂盒劇院的螢幕上播放時感到無比自豪。這真的是一次難忘的經歷。"

I used an aquarium video I took in Okinawa as the base, since I liked how the light shines through the water, and the fish’s movement fit the scene perfectly. Then, I added another video I shot on a random Chicago street, changed the blending mode to Hue, and added grain to the footage. I placed a cube on top with exclusion, then applied turbulence to the dark and cyan colors, added mesh wrap, and finally included a 4-color gradient with keyframed color positions. To finish, I added a film texture on top of the video.\n I include the references photos on Pinterest. I really like the gradient look and the contrasting colors. I used these images as my reference while working on this project.\n There are also two other color version I was testing. I wanted to see if there were better options than the original blue one.
